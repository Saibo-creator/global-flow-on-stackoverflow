            <p> A programmer's daily life is naver alone! A computer ,an IDE and <b>Stckoverflow!</b>
                You must have experienced the joy while a bug which torched you during sevevral hours fianlly resolved by two lines of code by someone from this magical programming Q&A website.<br>
                Have you ever wondered who are actully answering your questions ? <br>
                Are they in the same country as you or you are maybe in two poles of the Earth?<br>
                Are you curious about whether your country's people are more engaged in answering or asking questions?<br>
                In this site, we visualize the Question and Answer country origin from Stackoverflow as a map. <br><br>
                As one of the largest website for knowledge sharing among developers, we believe that we could gain some valuable insight in the global knowledge economy by examining the questions and and answers from Stackoverflow. <br> <br>
                We define knowledge flow between countries by the number of questions asked by users from one countries, by users of another country. <br><br>
                In the map below, you can find information about the knowledge flow between different countries among the world.<br> <br>
