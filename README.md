# global-flow-on-stackoverflow

In this site, we visualize the Question and Answer country origin from Stackoverflow as a map.

As one of the largest website for knowledge sharing among developers, we believe that we could gain some valuable insight in the global knowledge economy by examining the questions and and answers from Stackoverflow.

We define knowledge flow between countries by the number of questions asked by users from one countries, by users of another country.

In the map within the site, you can find information about the knowledge flow between different countries among the world.
